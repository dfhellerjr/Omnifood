# Omnifood Project

This repo contains the files for a project that is part of the Udemy course:
> Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3  
by Jonas Schmedtmann  

Omnifood is a mock-up for a single-page responsive app for a gourmet-prepared meal delivery service. It was designed by Jonas Schmedtmann for the purpose of demonstrating how to build beautiful & responsive websites using the advanced features of HTML5 and CSS3. It utilizes a responsive (fluid) grid system.

This repo contains my final version of this website which includes solutions to several challenges which were suggested by the instructor for further practice as well as a couple of new features I wanted to include. There is a small demonstration of the use of flex-box layout in pop-ups which are displayed upon clicking the images in the meals section. The app is nicely responsive to mobile devices with screen-widths as small as 320px.

In addition to the course material I used the following in my development process:

- The addition of an image slider for the cities using a stripped-down version of the jquery slick plugin - by Ken Wheeler: [https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick]
- Use of the embed-map iframe for the google map (no API key required) [https://embed-map.org]
- Gimp 2.10 for image importing/manipulation
- Inkscape 0.92 for svg creation
- Codepen for testing flexbox layouts and various other
- Autoprefixer CSS online: [https://autoprefixer.github.io/]
